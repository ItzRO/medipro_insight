This is a Flutter project used for multi-disease prediction.

## Getting Started

This application predicts upto 6 diseases. It includes both text input as well as image input for disease prediction.
It uses factual medical inputs for the particular disease to be predicted. 
We have used few Deep Learning and Machine Learning Algorithms for training each model for each disease.
We have integrated the database to the flutter application using Flask API.
